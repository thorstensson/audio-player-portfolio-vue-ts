# Audio Player. Amazon S3 + Web Audio API + P5.js

A compact mp3 player with audio visualization using the Web Audio API and P5.js. The music tracks are from artists I love listening to and meet CC license standards; no copyrighted material.

I've been absent from GitHub for a while, but I'm back. In a sweltering Barcelona summer, I've been busy working on my portfolio, a quite ambitious project that I'm proud of. Coming soon to a repo and URL near you. As a side effect, I'm also updating some linked labs.
